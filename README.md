NOTE: Do not run the python files from an IDE, instead, run
'python Coup_client.py' or 'python Coup.server.py' from a command interface
(Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac / Linux) OR
run the run_client.bat or run_server.bat file(s) on Windows

Before running Coup, go into Coup_server.py and Coup_client.py
and set HOST (on line 8 in server, and line 18 in client) to the
IP address of the host computer.

The host computer should run Coup_server.py (or run_server.bat)
before anyone runs Coup_client.py (or run_client.bat). If the
host computer is also a player for the game, they should
run Coup_client.py (or run_client.bat) as well.
